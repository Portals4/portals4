#summary Build instructions for libraries which support Portals 4

If you have a library which supports Portals 4 and is not listed, please let us know.

= Implementations =

== Open MPI ==

  * You'll need either a checkout of the SVN trunk or a nightly tarball:
{{{
svn co https://svn.open-mpi.org/svn/ompi/trunk
cd trunk
./autogen.sh

OR

http://www.open-mpi.org/nightly/trunk/
}}}

  * Then configure Open MPI.  If you're building for the OFED implementation, you'll want to use something like the following:
{{{
   ./configure --prefix=<PREFIX> \
      --with-portals4=<PORTALS4> \
      --with-platform=contrib/platform/snl/portals4-orte
   make all install
}}}

  * If you're building for the SHMEM implementation, you'll want to use something like the following:
{{{
   ./configure --prefix=<PREFIX> \
      --with-portals4=<PORTALS4> \
      --with-platform=contrib/platform/snl/portals4-shmem
   make all install
}}}

The implementation is still a work in progress and likely to die in strange ways.  The one-sided and collective algorithms have not been optimized for Portals 4 at this time.

== Portals SHMEM ==

  * An implementation of the OpenSHMEM specification over Portals 4 is available on [[http://code.google.com/p/portals-shmem/ Google Code]].
