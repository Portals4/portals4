= Draft Change History =

== November 29, 2011 Changelog ==
  * Clean up use of list entry instead of match list entry in event types description
  * Clarify mlength, particularly for Search events
  * Add PtlGetPhysId() call to allow the user to determine the physical address of a logically addressed network interface
  * Add feature bit PTL_COHERENT_ATOMICS to allow an implementation to specify that atomics are coherent with processor atomics and/or other network interface atomics
  * Clarify that unless explicitly allowed, NULL as a pointer to a structure/out argument is not allowed.
  * Allow a network interface to be reinitialized
  * First take at a guide to implementers
  * remove out of date FAQ
  * Clarify meaning of PTLACKREQ vs. PTLCTACKREQ vs. PTLOCACKREQ
  * Fix numerous typos

== October 20, 2011 Changelog ==
  * Clarify that MD_VOLATILE is only applicable to send buffers
  * Clarify VOLATILE applies to all sending operations in the constants table

== October 12, 2011 Changelog ==
  * Remove IN_USE check from MDRelease.  It's not clear there's a semantic need and it is burdensome for some implementations
  * Remove const from user_ptr type declaration
  * Add text saying that unexpected messages associated with an ME in the overflow list are deleted when the ME is explicitly unlinked
  * Clarify that event in Ptl{EQ,CT}{Get,Wait,Poll} must point to a valid structure (ie, not be NULL)
  * Fix description of ptllist argument to LEAppend and MEAppend to reflect search is no longer done through the append calls
  * Clean up language for LESearch and MESearch.  Event generation text now matches language of LEAppend/MEAppend, in that events can be turned off through le/me flags, and counting events could be turned on.
  * Fix wording of PtlCTWait and PtlCTPoll in presence of failures in the specified counting event(s).
